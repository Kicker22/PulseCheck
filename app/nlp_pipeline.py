# This code defines a simple NLP pipeline that performs sentiment analysis on a given text using the TextBlob library.
#expected output of test case:
    # Sentiment: positive, Score: >= 0.5
    # Themes: []
# The analyze_sentiment function takes a text input, creates a TextBlob object, and calculates the sentiment polarity.
# It then categorizes the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score.
# The function returns a dictionary containing the sentiment, sentiment score, and an empty list for themes (to be implemented later).
