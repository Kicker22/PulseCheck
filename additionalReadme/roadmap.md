#  PulseCheck: Future Roadmap

These features are outside of MVP scope but reflect the long-term vision for PulseCheck as a **real-time, ethical, and transparent patient experience intelligence platform**:

---

##  Real-Time Triggering
- Auto-send surveys based on simulated or real **discharge events**
- Support multiple delivery channels:
  - Email
  - SMS
  - Patient portal (optional FHIR integration)

---

##  Advanced NLP + AI Integration
- Swap in transformer-based models (e.g., DistilBERT, Sentence-BERT) for:
  - Semantic theme clustering
  - Emotion detection
  - Named provider attribution with contextual safety
- Use embeddings to group similar feedback across units or encounters

---

##  Provider Experience Dashboards
- Individualized feedback dashboards for physicians and team leads:
  - Aggregated themes
  - Anonymized comment streams
  - Weekly insights digest
- Emphasis on reflection, not punishment

---

##  Unit-Level and Org-Level Visualizations
- Emotion heatmaps by department
- Sentiment-over-time graphs
- Theme frequency histograms
- Real-time word clouds

---

##  Automated Trend Detection
- Flag high-risk trends:
  - Rising mentions of pain/confusion in a specific unit
  - Sudden drop in sentiment around a provider
- Alert clinical leadership to emerging quality gaps

---

## Export & Reporting
- Export anonymized weekly summaries to:
  - CSV
  - PDF
  - EHR inbox or BI dashboards (PowerBI, Tableau)
- Support basic HL7 or FHIR-compatible outputs (e.g., QuestionnaireResponse)

---

##  Privacy, Ethics & Security Enhancements
- Token-based anonymized feedback links
- Role-aware attribution safeguards (e.g., prevent mis-blaming)
- Optional opt-out or patient consent flow

---

##  OpenAPI + Integration Support
- RESTful API layer for integrating with:
  - EHRs
  - Existing patient experience platforms
  - Clinical governance tools
