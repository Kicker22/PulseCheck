## PulseCheck: Future Roadmap

PulseCheck is evolving beyond its MVP as a real-time feedback collector toward a robust, ethical, and transparent patient experience intelligence platform. The roadmap below outlines key future features aligned with clinical value, scalability, and privacy best practices.

---

### Real-Time Feedback Triggers

- Automatically send feedback requests upon patient discharge events
- Support multiple delivery channels:
  - Email
  - SMS
  - In-app delivery via patient portal (future FHIR integration)
- Include tracking for delivery success and response rates

---

### Advanced NLP and AI Integration

- Upgrade to transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for:
  - Semantic theme clustering
  - Emotion detection across a broader spectrum (e.g., fear, confusion, gratitude)
  - More accurate provider attribution with context safety checks
- Use sentence embeddings to identify similarity across feedback by time, department, or provider

---

### Provider and Team Dashboards

- Role-based dashboards for physicians, nurses, and team leads:
  - Theme breakdowns with sentiment scores
  - Anonymized comment streams
  - Weekly or monthly feedback digests
- Designed for coaching, not punishment

---

### Unit and Organization-Wide Analytics

- Department-level performance visualizations:
  - Sentiment-over-time graphs
  - Theme frequency charts
  - Emotion heatmaps
  - Feedback word clouds
- Cross-department comparison and benchmarking

---

### Automated Trend Detection and Alerts

- Identify patterns that may indicate clinical or operational concerns:
  - Spikes in negative feedback for specific units or individuals
  - Theme surges related to confusion, wait time, or bias
  - Drops in engagement over time
- Auto-alerts to admin dashboards or designated email recipients

---

### Reporting and Export Capabilities

- Export anonymized, filtered reports to:
  - CSV or PDF
  - EHR inboxes
  - Business Intelligence tools (PowerBI, Tableau)
- Future support for FHIR-compliant exports (e.g., QuestionnaireResponse)

---

### Privacy, Ethics, and Consent Handling

- Tokenized, one-time-use feedback links
- Optional opt-out or consent interface for patients
- Safeguards to avoid accidental misattribution of feedback
- Role-aware data visibility based on permissions

---

### OpenAPI and Integration Support

- Documented RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0 spec
- Integration-ready endpoints for:
  - EHR systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner)
  - Patient experience platforms
  - BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Looker)
- Support for polling, webhooks, and scheduled exports

---

### Stretch Goals and Long-Term Vision

- Mobile-friendly admin and provider dashboards
- Slack or Teams integration for snapshot-based alerts
- Provider well-being and reputation scoring over time
- In-app reflection prompts and learning tools
